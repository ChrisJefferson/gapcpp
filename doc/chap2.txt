  [33X[0;0YThe  central  functionality  of the Ferret package is based around the Solve
  method.  This  function  performs  a backtrack search, using the permutation
  backtracking  algorithm,  over  a  set of groups or cosets. Often users will
  want  to use a higher level function which wraps this functionality, such as
  Stabilizer  or  Intersection. The solve function accepts a list of groups or
  cosets,  and  finds their intersection. For efficiency reasons, these groups
  can  be  specified  in  a  variety of different ways. As an example, we will
  consider  how to implement Stabilizer(G, S, OnSets), the stabilizer of a set
  S  in  a  permutation  group  G  using Solve (this is not necessary, as when
  Ferret   is   loaded   this   method   is   replaced   with  a  Ferret-based
  implementation).  Another  way of viewing Stabilizer(G, S, OnSets) is as the
  Intersection  of  G with the Stabilizer of (Sym(n), S, OnSets), where Sym(n)
  is  the  symmetric  group  on  n  points,  and n is at least as large as the
  largest  moved  point  in  G.  Solve takes a list of objects which represent
  groups.  Two  of  these are ConInGroup(G), which represents the group G, and
  ConStabilize(S,  OnSets),  which represents the group which stabilizes S. We
  find   the   intersection  of  these  two  groups  by  Solve([ConInGroup(G),
  ConStabilize(S, OnSets)]).[133X
