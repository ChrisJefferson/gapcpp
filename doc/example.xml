<Index>Ferret package</Index>
This chapter describes the &GAP; package Ferret. Ferret implements highly efficient
implementations of a range of search algorithms on permutation groups. These
algorithms fall into two broad categories:

<List>
    <Item>
        <Emph>Algorithms which find groups and cosets with particular properties</Emph>. This include graph automorphisms, stabilizers and group intersection.
    </Item>
    <Item>
        <Emph>Canonical Images</Emph>. This involves finding the canonical image of an object (graph, set, list, transformation and others) in a given group of coset.
    </Item>
</List>


If you are interested in if Ferret can be applied to another problem, please contact the authors, who will be happy to look into if your problem can be solved with Ferret.

<Heading>Replacing Built-in functionality</Heading>

Ferret automatically installs methods which replace GAP's a number of GAP's built-in functionality:

<List>
    <Item>
        <Emph>Intersection</Emph> for a list of permutation groups.
    </Item>
    <Item>
        <Emph>Stabilizer(G,S,Action)</Emph> for a permutation group G, and the actions:
        <List>
            <Item>OnSets</Item>
            <Item>OnOnSets</Item>
            <Item>OnSetsDisjointSets</Item>
            <Item>OnSetsSets</Item>
            <Item>OnTuples</Item>
            <Item>OnPairs</Item>
            <Item>OnDirectedGraph</Item>
        </List>
    </Item>
    <Item>
        <Emph>Stabilizer(G, S)</Emph> for a permutation group G and a:
        <List>
            <Item>permutation</Item>
            <Item>transformation</Item>
            <Item>partial permutation</Item>
        </List>
    </Item>
</List>
